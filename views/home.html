                                    the normal school schedule may cause some disruption. The below options will be utilized sparingly and only when conditions make such procedures absolutely
                                    necessary. It is very important that you are prepared for such an emergency. Please make all necessary arrangements in advance for alternate supervision for your child/children in case of emergency closings. Our goal is to ensure care and safety for all students.</p>
