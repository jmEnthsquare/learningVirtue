                        <dt class="h3 text-primary" id="section-3">Are you an IT Guru, but lack communication skills?</dt>

                        <dd>We understand! In our professional careers, we have noticed that our talented IT professionals, though highly skilled in IT, have almost always faced challenges communicating their ideas or thoughts. That is a big drawback.</dd> <br>

                        <h4>Why is communication important to an IT professional?</h4> <br>

                        <dd>Consider this – In a technology driven office environment, organizations are trying to make everything cost effective. All IT related issues and tests are routed to the Indian IT departments from all over the world. Reason? It is simple - It is more cost effective and time effective as we provide quick responses. To cater to all the queries from around the world, communication skills becomes a must. With that, proficiency in English is also a must.
It is only via good and effective communication that an IT professional can help the end user understand the issue, how to solve it and how to avoid such issues in plain and simple English. If you have problem solving skills, you should also have the skill to show case it to your peers.</dd> <br>

                        <h4>Are Communication skills, Voice and Accent and Functional English different?</h4> <br>

                        <dd>Communication skills is different from Voice and Accent and Functional English.
Communication skills training module talks about various forms of communication – verbal and non-verbal and gives a good understanding on how to do so effectively. Whereas Voice and Accent training module talks about sounds in English, Accent of a particular country so that you can understand their spoken English, understanding of the common slangs, their work culture and also covers few important parts of Grammar.
Functional English, on the other hand, aims to develop communicative skills of learners in listening, speaking, writing and reading. The main focus is on how English is used in real-life situations. This module helps in developing fluency in conversation and efficiency in interactive skills. Grammar is studied more deeply in this module than it is done in Voice and Accent.
We have built separate modules to cater to the separate needs of a learner. <br> You can choose from the following options in which we can train you:</dd>

<ul class="marked-list-skin">
    <li><a ui-sref="college-corporate"> Soft skills Trainer </a></li>
<li><a ui-sref="communication-training"> Communication Trainer</a> </li>
 <li><a ui-sref="accent-training">Voice & Accent Trainer</a></li>
<li><a ui-sref="english-training">Functional English</a></li>
</ul>


<dt class="h3 text-primary" id="section-4">Did you lose an opportunity because you were not able to speak up?</dt> 
<dd>Don’t fret, we got you! Each of us has been in a situation where we have lost out on opportunities just because we haven’t been able to speak up or haven’t been able to come up with a suitable response to a given situation.
Upon some surveys we conducted and based on our research, we found that the following are the main reasons for the hesitation to speak up:</dd>

<ul class="marked-list-skin">

<li>Lack of confidence</li>
<li>Stage Fright</li>
<li>Low self confidence</li>
<li>Lack of communication skills</li>
<li>Low understanding of the ongoing conversation</li>
<li>Lack of effective presentation skills</li>
<li>Low level of crowd influence</li>
<li>Lack of listening skills</li>
<li>Public speaking issues</li>
<li>Lack of understanding of Adult Learning </li>
<li>Principles </li>
</ul> <br>

<dd>Understanding these reasons gave us a deep insight on the possible solutions. Most of these reasons route back to Soft skills that gives sessions on different topics like Personality Development, Influencing skills, Presentation effectiveness etc. However, as you can see above, there is a noticeable lack of communication related skills too. That is how the following programs were created:</dd>

<ul class="marked-list-skin">
    <li><a ui-sref="college-corporate"> Soft skills Trainer </a></li>
<li><a ui-sref="communication-training"> Communication Trainer</a> </li>
 <li><a ui-sref="accent-training">Voice & Accent Trainer</a></li>
<li><a ui-sref="english-training">Functional English</a></li>
</ul>


<dt class="h3 text-primary" id="section-5">Want to build up your personality & communication to crack an interview</dt>


<dd>We are here to help! Sooner or later we realize that we aren’t able to crack all the interviews we face. A rejection in an interview can be very de motivating. The first thought that comes to our mind is ‘I’m not good enough for that company, that’s why I didn’t get through’.
